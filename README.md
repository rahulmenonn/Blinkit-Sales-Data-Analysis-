# 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Blinkit retail sales data to uncover sales trends, revenue drivers, product performance, and outlet-level insights. The analysis focuses on transforming raw data into actionable business insights using Python.

# 🎯 Objectives

Understand overall sales distribution and revenue patterns

Analyze product categories and item attributes impacting sales

Evaluate outlet performance based on type, size, location, and age

Generate data-driven business recommendations

# 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset contains structured retail sales data with the following key features:

Product Attributes: Item Type, Item Fat Content, Item Weight, Item Visibility

Outlet Attributes: Outlet Type, Outlet Size, Outlet Location Type, Establishment Year

Performance Metrics: Sales, Customer Rating

Each record represents a product sold through a specific outlet.

# 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Standardized inconsistent category labels

Performed feature engineering such as outlet age calculation

Ensured correct data types for analysis

# 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis

The analysis includes:

Sales distribution and trend analysis

Category-wise and fat-content-wise performance comparison

Outlet-level analysis by size, type, location tier, and age

Relationship analysis between item visibility, ratings, and sales

# 📈 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation and analysis

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis workflow

# 💡 Key Insights

Outlet type and outlet size are major contributors to total sales

A small subset of product categories drives a large portion of revenue

Mature outlets consistently outperform newly established outlets

Item visibility improves sales only up to an optimal threshold

# ✅ Business Recommendations

Focus expansion on high-performing outlet types and sizes

Optimize inventory for top-performing product categories

Improve visibility for mid-performing products with growth potential

Support new outlets with targeted promotions during early stages
